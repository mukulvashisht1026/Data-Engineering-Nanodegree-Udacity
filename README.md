## Data Modeling with Postgres

  In this project, I applied Data Modeling with Postgres and built an ETL pipeline using Python.

  * Problem Statement: A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The     analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which     resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
    
    They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your         role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.
    
 
## Data Modeling with Cassandra

In this project, I applied Data Modeling with Cassandra and build an ETL pipeline using Python. Given the queries which analysts wants to query, I built the         data model around that.

  * Problem Statement: Similar to the above except certain queries were given around which the data model is supposed to work efficiently.
  
    - Get details of a song that was heard on the music app history during a particular session.
    - Get songs played by a user during particular session on music app.
    - Get all users from the music app history who listened to a particular song.
